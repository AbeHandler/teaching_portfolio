# Teaching portfolio

I am an instructor at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU). Because CU asks instructors to post materials to [Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/) most of my teaching materials are not available to everyone online. Therefore, I made this repo to showcase a collection of  materials from my classes. 

Other notes:
- Please feel free to reuse or modify these materials for your own purposes. If you do so, please let me know. 
- See my [website](https://www.abehandler.com/teaching/) for a little bit more context about these materials. 
- Assignments are posted without solutions. If you are an instructor and would like a copy of solutions, please send me an email. 
- I see teaching materials as works in progress. I am always improving and updating them. If you spot a bug, find something confusing or have an idea for an improvement, please send me an email!

The repo is organized into folders:
- `quantitative_reasoning` includes materials from a lower-division quantitative reasoning class
